# 🍹 Highball & Harvest | Premium Web Experience

## 📖 Project Vision
Highball & Harvest offers a "rustic-refined" Southern experience. However, traditional websites often fail to capture this level of luxury on mobile devices. This Web App was built to eliminate technical friction and provide guests with a digital experience that matches the world-class service of the Ritz-Carlton.

### 🛠 Issues Solved
* **Performance:** Replaced slow-loading assets with optimized, next-gen image formats.
* **Navigation:** Eliminated complex menu hierarchies in favor of a "thumb-friendly" mobile UI.
* **Conversion:** Streamlined the path to the reservation system to reduce guest drop-off.
* **Brand Continuity:** Modernized the typography and layout to align with contemporary luxury standards.

---

## ✨ Key Features
* **App-Like Feel:** Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for smooth transitions and instant loading.
* **Smart Menus:** Interactive, categorized digital menus for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and the Bar.
* **Direct Booking:** Integrated reservation CTA that stays persistent as the user scrolls.
* **Responsive Architecture:** Pixel-perfect display across all iOS and Android devices.
* **High-Fidelity Visuals:** Optimized gallery showcasing the farm-to-table culinary philosophy.
